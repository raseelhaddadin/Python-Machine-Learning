# Python-Machine-Learning
Sample code I worked on for my Data Analysis with Python class.
I was able to use machine learning on a kaggle dataset to determine which variables were the most valuable in determining whether we should default on a loan or not. 
The code was initially run on Vocareum, this is simply a copy of the code that was created thus the path for the file is unavailable for this copy.
